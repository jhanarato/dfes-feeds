# firefeed-wa
A python package for receiving alerts from the WA DFES

The [Department of Fire and Emergency Services](https://dfes.wa.gov.au/) provides emergency notifications for Western Australia. They provide alerts [via RSS](https://www.emergency.wa.gov.au/#cap-rss). This project captures the available alerts for **Fire Danger Ratings** and **Total Fire Bans** and provides them via a Python API. I envision an IoT project using this API.
